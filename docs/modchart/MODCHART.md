# FunkinModchart

## An Modcharting system for Friday Night Funkin' made by [TheoDev](https://github.com/TheoDevelops)

**FunkinModchart**[^1] is a tool designed to bring [NotITG](https://www.noti.tg/) visuals and capabilities to [Friday Night Funkin](https://ninja-muffin24.itch.io/funkin), adding modifiers to change the **arrow trajectory, colors, transparency and the  rotation angle through 3D Axes**, event system to change the modifier's percent easing or setting those to create endless amazing visual effects and even **more**!.

This framework also provides **extra features** that can help you to make even more crazy visuals, as **arrow paths, 3D view camera, AFTs**, etc. *(If you have already modeled NotITG or StepMania, you know what I am talking about)*

[Documentation here](https://github.com/TheoDevelops/FunkinModchart/blob/main/DOC.md)

**NOTE**: It is recommended to use `#if MODCHARTING_FEATURES` in your modchart scripts in order to no break your mod if is used in vanilla Codename Engine
